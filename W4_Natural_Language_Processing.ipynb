        "Exxon Mobil is the 4th largest oil company in the world. In 1978, an Exxon scientist named James Black wrote an [internal briefing](https://insideclimatenews.org/documents/james-black-1977-presentation/) called \"The Greenhouse Effect\" in which he warned: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than acting on this information, Exxon spent the next [forty years aggressively funding climate denial](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/oil-companies-discourage-climate-action-study-says/). Recently, [a U.S. court ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/exxon-trial-climate-crimes-fossil-fuels-global-heating) that ExxonMobil must face trial over accusations that it lied about the climate crisis and covered up the fossil fuel industry’s role in worsening environmental devastation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Earnings Calls\n",
        "Every three months, Exxon conducts an [\"earnings call\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-call.asp); a conference call between the management of a public company, analysts, investors, and the media to discuss the company’s financial results during a given reporting period, such as a quarter or a fiscal year.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can [register](https://globalmeet.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1488251&tp_key=440e363aaf) to attend their next one if you want! No worries if you miss it, they provide [transcripts](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Investors/Investor-relations/Investor-materials-archive#Quarterlyearningsmaterials) on their website.\n",
        "\n",
        "These transcripts provide an intimate window into the company's dealings. We can see how much pressure investors are putting on the company to tackle climate change, and how the company responds.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll be working with transcripts spanning nealry 20 years and over 10 million words; that's like reading the Harry Potter series 10 times. Then, we'll look at a sample of 100,000 tweets that use the #ExxonKnew hashtag, and analyze public pressure on the company."
